My name is Daniel (Danny) Ullrich and Iâ€™m currently a student at Allegheny College majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Art, Science, and Innovation (ASI). I have been programming since I was 10 years old and I have always had a passion for all things technology and DIY. I am a maker and a tinkerer using my skills as a computer scientist to explore the intersection of art and technology, usually through the lens of a camera.

From video games to websites and security, I am interested in all things technology and computer science. I enjoy learning new skills and platforms in the pursuit of elegant solutions to problems.
