The place between the here and there, then and now; a place of transition. The transition between your starting point to your end point. It can be physical or emotional. Examples include places like airports, it's a point of transition between where you came from and your destination where rules aren't really known, ie. you can have a drink in an airport at 7 in the morning and no one will see it as out of place. The goal is to capture this feeling of the unknown, this feeling of in-between and transition. Technically speaking I have been really enjoying the look by softening the image a bit with blur, subtle blur followed by a healthy portion of desaturation to really drive home that dreamlike state. Iâ€™m purposely foregoing corrective edits such as lens distortion correction and vignette correction to help distance the photos from reality and further push them into the ethereal. Beyond location I am interested in exploring the human element of liminal spaces, the spaces that are beyond the physical and finding a way to convey that through visuals. I am choosing subjects that reside in a place of transition such as the bus bench and the parking garage. To explore this idea of transition and the places and feelings we have during these states. We are all privy to this feeling and idea but with this series of photographs I want to help people learn to identify this space and embrace it.
