Each of the subjects are framed by the mirror to show the way we frame ourselves for other people, with the outside of the frame melting away with bokeh emulating our focus on ourselves and how we interact with the world. Using a mirror is a direct reference to self reflection, the way we look at ourselves in the mirror compared to what others see. The colors have been muted and haze has been added to try to show how distorted our views can be compared to reality. The melancholy tonality of the series is to show the extent how affected we are by the pressures we place on ourselves. The circular frame separates the subject from the rectangular frame of the photograph also emulating how disconnected from reality our personal perceptions of ourselves are. Our perceptions are subject to our own bias. All these choices firmly plant the series in an alternate reality, much like the ones we place ourselves in inside our minds everyday.
